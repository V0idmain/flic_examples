Flic buttons lack built in support to play sonos radio stations (as of this day...). This code allows you to play sonos stations in response to flic events (tested with sonos/pandora radio).

1. Git setup with the hub SDK https://flic.io/flic-hub-sdk
2. From https://hubsdk.flic.io/ add a new module called sonos_radio_example
3. Add the code in this directory to your new module
4. Read the instructions in the main.js and make changes as needed (like your ip address, playlists, etc...)
